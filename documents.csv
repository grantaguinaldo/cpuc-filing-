The post-presentation discussion was attended by Forest Kaser, advisor to Cmmr. Picker.  Mr. Chien, referring to the three-prong test for fuel substitution programs in this proceeding, stated that the Commission is reviewing the three-pronged test, and that currently, the test generally prevents the use of ratepayer funds to support “fuel substitution” measures, which affects the City’s plans to reduce carbon emissions including from use of fossil fuels for thermal end uses, such as water heating. San Francisco did not make any requests or recommendations with regard to the three-prong test."

Menten described the capacity challenges that are faced by small program administrators, and indicated that the staff of MCE may need to scale back engagement efforts with the EE Coordinating Committee. However, Menten did not believe this would cause concerns because as local government agencies, CCAs are already subject to a variety of rules related to transparency.  Menten voiced concerns on the methodology of ex ante review and indicated an open and transparent forum for saving estimate review offered by the Technical Forum would be a welcome change.

ORA expressed concern that the Commission’s decisions will be too expansive given the energy efficiency goals of AB 802 without information from the energy efficiency “To-Code” pilots. ORA representatives urged the Commission to encourage timely completion of the pilots."

ESCO representatives discussed the application of AB 802 to energy efficiency (EE) programs. ESCO representatives said that they believe that AB 802 offers the Commission an historic opportunity to simplify the administration of California EE programs, which has become unnecessarily complex over the past ten years, particularly in the area of savings baselines and EM&V. Gilligan said that this complexity makes the California programs less effective than in other states.  ESCO participants provided examples of projects and programs which they believe are hindered by the current Title 24 and Industry Standard Practice baselines. The ESCO participants urged the Commission to address the issue of the workload of the Energy Division, and stated that the current workload can result in untimely delivery of key reports and a growing lag between the accelerating innovation in EE technology and the incorporation of these technologies into EE programs.

Taha reminded the Commissioner of their meeting 2 years ago in which she and Eckhart reviewed the barriers facing low and moderate income ratepayers from receiving the best and most innovative conservation programs from other regions where they have been found cost effective and beneficial to these customers.  Taha noted a key element of their success in the northwest was the Regional Technical Forum which they believed would help California address M&V processes which needed to be reworked.  Eckhart shared his observations having served over the past year and a half on the CALTF.  Eckhart stated his concern that the CALTF did not have formal standing and having the CPUC to define technical and policy roles for the Energy Division and Commission representatives could be helpful.  Eckhart observed that without Commission feedback and participation out of state participation from volunteers and experts could diminish."

At the meeting, Nexant briefed on a staff disposition that would deny energy efficiency savings claimed for a Nexant industrial retrocommissioning project. Nexant explained that air compressor projects represent significant energy efficiency savings potential, and it is not industry standard practice to repair air leaks in air compressor systems unless the air compressors are not meeting the customer's end use needs. Nextant further explained that Title 24 is not triggered in this instance and that Staff's characterization of the air compressor project as a ""to code"" project was incorrect.  Nextant also stated that it is prohibited from communicating directly with staff regarding errors in the disposition; and that because Nexant is a third party implementer, and not the Program Administrator, there is no clear process for it to appeal or seek review of the staff disposition."

Goodson specifically discussed governance, oversight, and funding issues related to SB 765.  Goodson also briefly discussed potential changes to the Commission's policies on energy efficiency baselines. Goodson mentioned the importance of considering the totality of interrelated policies that should be revisited in conjunction with baselines, such as assumptions about savings from the Codes and Standards program and inputs into the demand forecast. Written material (attached to the notice) was used."

Efficiency Council's representatives discussed Assembly Bill 1330, a bill currently introduced in the  
California Legislature, which is sponsored by the Efficiency Council.  The Efficiency Council representatives explained that this legislation could work in conjunction with the goal setting process within the proceeding, as it simply establishes a ""floor"" by which energy savings through efficiency must be achieved.  Schiller explained that since energy efficiency is a resource that all Californians can benefit from, the Efficiency Council felt that it was important to ensure disadvantage communities were included in a major way in the state's energy efficiency efforts.
